# Contact Form Submission Processor
This is a project I made using AWS Lambda, Python, and Terraform.

## Feature List
- A cloud function hosted on Amazon Web Services: Lambda that processes form submissions on my website hosted on GitHub Pages.
- Fully managed using Terraform.
- Enables Form Submissions on a static website through cloud computing.

## Difficulties Encountered
- Learning Amazon Web Services seemed really intimidating at first but through an analysis of the features that made sense in this scenario (Lambda, Simple Email Service) it proved to be much easier than expected.

## Reflection
This project was really far out of my comfort zone when it came to a mix of various technologies. More than anything it taught me that all of these technologies exist to make developing a more streamlined process. I definitely will be looking into more uses for cloud computing.
